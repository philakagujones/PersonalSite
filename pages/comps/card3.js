                Our cat, Puddles, never missed breakfast, until today. When I told my daughter, she said the dolls, which she tucked in their beds each night, were also missing. Puddles loved to play with themâ€”carrying them by the hair, leaving a porcelain hand poking from under the couch or a tiny spikey shoe at the top of the steps.
